      <p class="text-body1 q-mt-sm">
        The ranking of the filmmakers is done based on this score. The
        popularity score is calculated based on aspects such as the number of
        films submitted, ratings, reviews, recommendations, and followers of the
        filmmaker. Higher the popularity score, the higher the chances of
        raising the funds for the upcoming projects.

        The filmmakers must focus on building the ‘Popularity Score’. After a
        certain level, a filmmaker would be able to raise funds for their
        upcoming projects. The level at which a filmmaker gets to raise funds
        will be activated as the progress of the filmmaker advances in the
        ‘Fund-ready’ meter. Once a filmmaker gets ready to raise a fund
        Moviepedia Films will contribute to a portion of the fund that is to be
        raised. Moviepedia Teams will strictly scrutinize the popularity of the
        filmmaker and the nature and size of the project before approving any
        fundraiser.
